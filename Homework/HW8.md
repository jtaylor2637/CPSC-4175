1) I believe the Unified Process being viewed as adaptive is true, the company should utilize the core work flows, but they can focus more on whichever one they deem more important, and also change how the process works depending on the project.

2) Yes I believe this to be true, in order to progress through the development cycle, you must complete the phases in order to create quality software, I believe the spiral process is similar in that you follow the phases as the size and complexity increases. I don't see any differences between the two.

3) Requirements work flow where the team determines the client's needs and problem domain. Analysis work flow requires analyzing the requirements to get a deeper understanding of what the project requires. Design work flow refines the analyzed requirements into a form that can be implemented. Implementation work flow is to implement the software and all of its requirements. Test work flow is making sure the software works and does what it is supposed to do from the requirements.

4) The software project management plan shows which members of the team are working on which work flow and the deadlines for every stage of the project, this helps guide the team to estimate which point of the software development process they should be at. I don't think it could replace the process because it relies on the software process to function well.

5) The test work flow depends on the artifacts being tested. So each test is different depending on which work flow we are testing at the time. No, because I believe testing is done through each phase, therefore it makes sense to test each artifact.

6) Post delivery maintenance could be something that is done at least once every period of time, and go through the spiral process for each period as you are updating the software to fix the issues discovered.

7) I believe these approaches support each other, looking at the five work flows with the four phases on each one it shows more of a business standpoint of the software process along with the actual development of the project, such as if the project is worth developing to the customer etc.

8) The waterfall model still requires to plan everything prior to working on anything in the process, and therefore would not be as adaptive as the spiral model even if viewed as the cascade many rapids view.

9) Improving software is improving the quality of the software in some way, either through efficiency or usefulness. Improving the process is improving how you produce software as in how long it takes to produce a quality product, or reducing the amount of faults / errors made in design or implementation in future projects. I believe software process improvement is very important because it allows you to produce higher quality software more quickly than other companies, which means more contracts and therefore more profit.
