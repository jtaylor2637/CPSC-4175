1) I believe that changing requirements is more important for this difference, as oftentimes clients don't know exactly what they want, or how to explain it well, therefore the requirements change during the life cycle of the project and result in another cycle of phases needing to be completed.

2) The book means that the waterfall model goes through a cycle over and over, but does not add anything more to the project each time it goes through the cycle.

3) I believe that most of us here at csu use step wise refinement just to get through each semester. Sometimes we have too many assignments due, so we have to focus on the ones that are either due first or take the least amount of time. I believe I have used this model successfully as I am on my senior year of college and have survived each semester.

4) In the case where requirements is through every phase you would have a much higher chance of your client getting his requirements met in the final version. In the case where testing starts in iteration 2, you may miss out on crucial testing in iteration 1 that may not show up until later, costing more money.

5) I would explain in like how I developed games, first you create a small working prototype of your game, then you add on more and more small features to the game until it reaches alpha, then after getting your alpha tested, you move on to update the game for beta, then the final version. Each step is adding more pieces and possibly changing the older version of code for the better.

6) In a business scenario, I would agree with this statement, but I don't think many businesses nowadays would like to spend the extra time developing documentation for each phase when they have hard deadlines to meet and overhead costs to account for. I would have to spend more time in my process making sure that everything I do is more documented and noted, because typically I only document code.

7) I feel most comfortable with the iterative and incremental model and the spiral life cycle model because that's what I am most used to. These processes appeal to me because they start small and work their way up to the full project in a reasonable way, and works really well in practical real world situations. Spiral method also helps reduce risk in the project which is really important in the business world.

8) This article just seems to cover how to express recursive functions through mathematical statements. It wants to build on functions to make them easier to be abstracted. By simplifying these functions, they can use another function to call another function all done recursively until the whole program is done in a sequence of recursive calls. My appeal for mathematical formulas and functions isn't very high so I do not appreciate this article as much as other students might. However I can appreciate the power that this kind of thinking can bring for the computation world.
